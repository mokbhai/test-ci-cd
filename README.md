# Regression Test Runner

This repository contains a regression test runner that can be executed via GitHub Actions to run automated tests for your project.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository
- Access to the DrCode and Project Id.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set in your GitHub repository:

| Variable     | Description                                       | Required | Default     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `NODE_ENV`   | Environment (development/production)              | No       | development |
| `PROJECT_ID` | Your DrCode project ID                            | Yes      | -           |
| `EMAILS`     | Comma-separated list of email addresses to notify | Yes      | -           |

## GitHub Actions Setup

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository if it doesn't exist:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```

2. Create a new workflow file (e.g., `ci.yml`) in the `.github/workflows` directory with the following content:

   ```yaml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline

   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]
     pull_request:
       branches: [main]

   env:
     REGISTRY: ghcr.io
     IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}
     NODE_ENV: development
     PROJECT_ID: 905 # Replace with your project ID
     EMAILS: "your-email@example.com" # Replace with your email
     TEST_IMAGE: mokshitjain18/drcode-regression-test-runner:latest

   jobs:
     deploy-and-test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Run regression tests
           run: |
             docker run \
               -e NODE_ENV=${{ env.NODE_ENV }} \
               -e PROJECT_ID=${{ env.PROJECT_ID }} \
               -e EMAILS=${{ env.EMAILS }} \
               --name drcode-regression-test-runner \
               ${{ env.TEST_IMAGE }}
           continue-on-error: true

         - name: Check container logs
           if: always()
           run: |
             docker logs drcode-regression-test-runner

         - name: Cleanup container
           if: always()
           run: |
             docker rm -f drcode-regression-test-runner || true
   ```

3. Configure GitHub Secrets (Optional):

   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
   - Add the following secrets if you want to keep them private:
     - `PROJECT_ID`
     - `EMAILS`

   Then update the workflow file to use secrets:

   ```yaml
   env:
     PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
     EMAILS: ${{ secrets.EMAILS }}
   ```

## Understanding the Workflow

The workflow consists of three main steps:

1. **Run regression tests**: Executes the test runner container with the specified environment variables
2. **Check container logs**: Displays the test execution logs
3. **Cleanup container**: Removes the container after execution

### Test Results Format

The test results will be displayed in a structured format:

```
üìä Test Results Summary:
=====================
Total Tests: X
‚úÖ Passed: Y
‚ùå Failed: Z
‚è≥ Pending: W

üìù Detailed Results:
=====================
1. Test Name
   Status: ‚úÖ PASSED
   Last Run: [timestamp]
```

## Manual Testing

To test locally:

1. Pull the test runner image:

   ```bash
   docker pull mokshitjain18/drcode-regression-test-runner:latest
   ```

2. Run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run \
     -e NODE_ENV=development \
     -e PROJECT_ID=your_project_id \
     -e EMAILS=your-email@example.com \
     --name drcode-regression-test-runner \
     mokshitjain18/drcode-regression-test-runner:v1
   ```

3. Check the logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs drcode-regression-test-runner
   ```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Container fails to start**:

   - Check if all required environment variables are set
   - Verify the Docker image exists and is accessible
   - Check Docker logs for detailed error messages

2. **Tests not running**:

   - Verify the PROJECT_ID is correct
   - Check if the API endpoints are accessible
   - Ensure the EMAILS variable is properly formatted

3. **No logs visible**:
   - The workflow includes a separate step to show logs
   - Check the GitHub Actions logs for the "Check container logs" step

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify your environment variables and configuration
3. Contact support if the issue persists
